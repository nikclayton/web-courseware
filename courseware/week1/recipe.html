<h1>Creme Brulee</h1>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>You will need (serves <span class="serves">6-8</span>):

<ul>
  <li>6-8 x 180ml ramekins</li>
  <li>large roasting pan or ovenproof dish</li>
  <li>blowtorch (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>568ml (1pt) double cream</li>
  <li>200ml whole milk</li>
  <li>10 large egg yolks</li>
  <li>75g caster sugar (for the custard)</li>
  <li>1 vanilla pod</li>
  <li>50g caster sugar (for the topping)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 130C</li>

  <li>Prepare a kettle full of boiling water.</li>

  <li>Put the egg yolks and sugar in to a large mixing bowl (large
    enough to also hold the milk and cream as well as the eggs), and
    whisk until blended. You just want to mix them, you're not trying
    to beat lots of air in to them, so do this gently by hand rather
    than with an electric mixer. Put this to one side.</li>

  <li>Pour the cream and the milk in to a saucepan (you can replace the
    milk with another 200ml of cream if you want, that gives a heavier
    custard at the end).</li>

  <li>Split the vanilla pod in two, scrape out the seeds, add them to the
    pan, and then put the vanilla pod in too.</li>
  <li>Heat gently, until almost boiling.</li>

  <li>When the milk + cream + vanilla is almost boiling pour it carefully
    over the eggs + sugar and gently whisk until it's blended. Again,
    don't try and beat air in to it.</li>

  <li>In a fresh saucepan (or, thoroughly clean out the one you were
    using, it's very important that there's no remaining milk in it), pour
    the eggs + sugar + milk + cream + vanilla in, and put back on a low
    heat. Stir it gently and frequently, and scrape the bottom and edges
    of the saucepan too. You're waiting for it to start to thicken
    up. It's thick enough when you can take the spoon you're stirring it
    with out of the mixture and it stays on the spoon, instead of all
    running off ("coats the back of the spoon", as most recipes say). This
    normally happens within 5 minutes or so, depending on how hot the milk
    was.</li>

  <li>This is the point where it can all go horribly wrong -- if the heat's
    up too high you don't get custard, you get scrambled eggs. If that
    happens, take it off the heat, pour in to another cool bowl, and whisk
    it vigorously until the lumps disappear, then put it back on a gentler
    heat and keep stirring.</li>

  <li>Once it's thickened take it off the heat, and remove the vanilla
    pod.</li>

  <li>Transfer the mixture in to the ramekins. Use a ladle, or just pour
    it all in to a measuring jug, and go from there. Let it come almost to
    the top of the ramekins. If your custard's not completely smooth you
    can strain it through a sieve.</li>

  <li>Place the ramekins in to the roasting dish, and then pour boiling
    water around them, so it looks like they're sat in a bath. You want
    the water to come at least halfway up the ramekins, 2/3rds is great
    too. If you need to top it up with non-boiling water that's fine.</li>

  <li>Transfer to the oven, and bake for 35-40 minutes. You can give
    them a gentle shake to check that they're ready -- they should wobble
    a bit, but shouldn't look liquid. Don't poke them, there'll be a skin
    on top, and you don't want to break that.</li>
  
  <li>Take them out of the water bath, and let them cool completely. At
    this point they should look golden on top, pale yellow underneath,
    with flecks of vanilla in them.</li>

  <li>When they're cooled put them in the fridge until you're ready to
    serve them.</li>

  <li>When you're going to serve them scatter a tbsp of sugar on top. I
    normally then hold them up, and gently tap them on the side with the
    ramekin at a bit of an angle to make sure it's evenly
    distributed. Don't put the sugar on any earlier, otherwise it will
    just slowly dissolve in to the custard.</li>

  <li>Then caramalise the sugar. Either use a cook's blowtorch, or if
    you don't have one to hand you can put them back in the roasting tin,
    fill it with *ice* water, again up to 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way up the
    ramekins, and then put them under a very hot grill for 3 to 4
    minutes. That's not as much fun as a blowtorch though.</li>

  <li>Leave for a minute to set, and then serve.</li>
</ol>
