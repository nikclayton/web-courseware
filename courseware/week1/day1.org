#+BEGIN_NOTES

This is a special week -- no guest trainers so that I can get them up to
speed and spend more time with them to see who struggles, get a better feel
for the class, etc.

#+END_NOTES

* Welcome

- Course agreement and expectations
- Asking questions is absolutely fine
- "All teaching is the process of lying, and then replacing the lies
  with successively better approximations of the truth."
- Tell me if I need to speak more slowly

* Logistics

- Wifi
- Bathrooms
- Schedule and breaks
- Communications (Slack etc)

#+BEGIN_NOTES

#+END_NOTES

* Common mistakes

- Not enough / too much space
- Using the wrong quotes, ' vs "
- Using the wrong case
- Mis-spellings
- Number 1 vs. letter l

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Progamming is a precision activity. Sometimes using an upper
case letter instead of a lower case letter can cause something
to not work.

Or having the wrong amount of spaces.

Or spelling things wrong. Or using the wrong quotes.

When I was hosting the interviews, the #1 problem I saw people
make was not following the examples / instructions precisely.

This is a skill that you will need to learn.
#+END_NOTES

* TODO Goals for this week

- Get everyone on the same page
- Introductions to:
  - HTML
  - Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)
  - Version control

* Files and directories

- Information is stored in files.
- Files have names and extensions
- Extensions are a convention that indicate the file's contents
  - Windows can try and be too clever, and hide them. Find the option to turn this off, as otherwise it will get very confusing.


#+BEGIN_NOTES
Everything you do as a web developer is going to involve working with files,
so it's important that you have a good mental model of how they work.

A file is a collection of information. That information might be the text of
a web page, or the data that makes up an image, or an audio file, or the data
that make up anything else.

Each file has a filename. We say that the filename is made up of three parts,
which are:

- The basename
- A full-stop character. We tend to call this 'dot'.
- Generally 1-4 characters after the dot, called the 'extension'

Conventionally, the extension is used to describe the type of data that is in
the file. For example:

- .txt  -- text files
- .html -- HTML files (more on these later)
- .png  -- Portable Network Graphics (a type of image)
- .css  -- Cascading Style Sheet (also more later)
- .js   -- Javascript (much more, later)

However, this is just a convention, and it's possible for a file's extension
to *not* match its actual contents. This can cause problems, so we'll look
at that later.

#+END_NOTES

** Show extensions on Windows

 - TODO(nik): Find image that shows how to do this

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 For those of you with Windows computers we need to make a small change.

 Trying to be helpful, Windows has a default configuration option that means
 it won't show you a file's extension. This is incredibly unhelpful when
 you're a frontend developer, so we need to turn that off now.

 TODO(nik): Instructions.
 #+END_NOTES

** Directories

 - Files are stored in directories (folders)
 - Like boxes. You can put a file in a box.
 - You can also put a box in a box.
 - This gives us a "nested" structure

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 Files are placed in collections -- the modern name for these
 collections is a "folder". However, the earlier name was
 "directory". That name is in the name of lots of commands that we'll
 use, and is still very widespread, so that's the name we'll use.

 You can think of a directory as being like a box that you can put
 files in to. You can also put a directory inside another directory --
 like putting a box inside a box.

 When we do this we say that one directory is *nested* inside the
 other.

 If you imagine that you're inside one of these boxes-as-directories,
 and climb out of it, you'll find yourself in another directory. If you
 keep doing this you'll eventually find that you can't climb out any
 more -- you've reached the *root* directory.

 The root directory has a special name, '/', or 'slash' (or forward
 slash).
 #+END_NOTES

** Paths

 - Each file is in exactly one directory
 - "path" is the route to the file through all the directories it is in,
   starting from the root.
 - /.../..../... TODO(nik): Use a plausible full path here

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 A file can only ever be in one directory at a time.

 This means that we can uniquely identify a file by starting at the
 root directory and then listing all the directories that we have to go
 through to get to file.

 We separate these directory names with a '/' slash character too.
 #+END_NOTES

** The directory tree (family tree)

 TODO: Image of a family tree (use a zoomed out version of mine)

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 Another way of thinking about this directory structure is as what
 computer scientists call a "tree".

 This is a bit like a family tree. There are special English terms for
 people in the tree, including

 - parent
 - grandparent
 - sibling (like a brother or sister)

 #+END_NOTES

** The directory tree

 TODO: Image of a directory tree. Arrows or other highlights for:

 - Root directory
 - A file
 - It's parent directory
 - Sibling directories, etc

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 This is a bit like that family tree, although it's been turned upside
 down.

 At the top of the tree is the root directory.

 Below that we have various child directories.

 And here we can see the file, with its filename.

 We say these this (indicate slide) is the parent directory for this
 directory. Which means that this, this, and this are all child directories
 of it.

 And these directories (indicate slide) are siblings of each other.

 Computer scientists love trees. You'll be seeing stuff like this a lot.
 #+END_NOTES

** Familiar directory trees

 TODO: Screenshots of directory trees in Windows Explorer, OS X Finder,
 etc, to show that this isn't an alien concept for them.

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 You're probably more familiar with the directory trees when it's
 presented like this, but all the same features are there.

* Break / or recap slide that shows the terms

* Introduction to the web

- Web page
- Web browser
- Web server

#+BEGIN_NOTES
At its heart, a web page is a file that contains text and special codes
to specify how the text should be displayed.

This file is read by a web browser; like Chrome, or Firefox, or Safari.
The browser uses the information in the text and the special codes to
generate the final page that you can interact with.

A web server is special software that the browser talks to in order to
download a web page. We'll cover that in more detail a lot later.
#+END_NOTES

** Web pages are just text

- Open https://www.powercoders.org/
- Right-click on the page
- Choose "View source" from the menu that appeara

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is text for the Powercoders home page. There's a lot here that at
least some of you will never have seen before. But even then you can
start to make out some structure to the content.
#+END_NOTES

** Create a scratch directory

- Go to your home directory
- Create a directory called =poco=
- Create a directory inside =poco= called =scratch=

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The =scratch= directory is where we are going to store HTML and other
files that are temporary, and you can use for experimentation. Later on
we'll create other directories for longer lived projects.
#+END_NOTES

** Open a text editor

- Windows: Notepad
- OS X: TODO(nik): Fill this in

** Copy the following exactly

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<p>This is an HTML paragraph.</p>

#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_NOTES

#+END_NOTES

** Save it

- Use "Save As"
- Find the =poco/scratch= directory you created
- Save it as =index.html=

** Load it in to your browser

- TODO(nik): Demo

** Compare the result

- TODO(nik): Show screenshot

* What have we just done?
 
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language
- 1 element, =p=
- Start tag, content, end tag

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<p>This is an HTML paragraph.</p>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
You've just created and loaded an HTML file.

HTML is *not* a programming language, it's a markup language, and we
use it to define the structure of the web page.


An HTML file consists of one or more elements, which you use to *mark
up* different parts of the page to make it appear or behave in a
particular way.  The type of element used determines whether it's a
paragraph, or an image, or a link, or anything else that HTML
supports.

An element has three main parts.

It begins with the *start tag*. This is the name of the element
surrounded by *angle brackets*. This says where the element starts.

It ends with the *end tag*. This is like the start tag, except that
the name of the element is preceded by a *forward slash*.

In between the start tag and the end tag is the element's
*content*. In this example that's the text of the element.

Together, the start tag, content, and end tag make up the element.

#+END_NOTES

** Nesting elements

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<p>This is an <em>HTML paragraph</em>.</p>
#+END_SRC

- =em= element is *nested* inside the =p= element

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Elements can be placed inside other elements. We say that they *nest*
inside each other.

For example, we can use the =em= element to make some text in the
paragraph be emphasised.

Try that -- make the change, save, and reload the file.
#+END_NOTES

** Elements can not overlap

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<p>This is a <em>bad example.</p><em>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Elements *must* *not* overlap. You can not close an element unless all
the elements that it contains are closed first.

If you get this wrong the browser will try and guess what you meant.
Sometimes you get lucky and everything looks OK, and sometimes you get
very strange results.
#+END_NOTES

** Block-level and inline elements

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<p><em>One</em> <em>two</em> <em>three</em></p>

<p>four</p> <p>five</p> <p>six</p>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Broadly, we can put HTML elements in to two groups.

The first are called *block-level* elements. They form a new block on
the page -- there will be a blank line before and after each block
level elements.

These tend to represent large-scale structure on the page, so things
like

- headings
- paragraphs
- lists
- menus

and so on.

The second are called *inline elements*. These are always contained
inside a block-level element and normally only surround a small part
of the content.

Examples include:

- emphasis
- links

Try this example, save, and reload. But before you do that, try and
imagine what you think the result will be, and see if you get it
right.

#+END_NOTES

** A more complicated example

#+BEGIN_SRC html -n
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>

    <p>This is a single paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here's a more complicated example that introduces some new elements
and best practices.

The first thing to notice is the indentation. HTML does not require
you to do this -- the browser will ignore it. However, as you can see
it makes the nested structure of the document very easy to see, to so
it is very good practice to get in to.

From now on, you should make sure that all of the HTML that you write
has correct indentation. I do that be indenting by two spaces for
each new block level element.

Lets look at this line by line.

The first line specifies the *document type*. This looks a little bit
like an element, but it isn't. Back when HTML was first being
developed the idea was that there might be lots of different document
types, and this line would tell the browser what type it was and what
rules to follow. That never really worked out, so now you just need to
include this one.

Note that the second character is an exclamation mark.

The second line is the opening tag for the =html= element. This element
should contain all the content on the page. You will also hear this
called the root element.

The =html= element should contain two child elements. The next line
introduces the first of these, =head=. This element is used to contain
various bits of additional information -- we call it *metadata* about
the page.

Here, the =head= contains a =title= element, with some text content.

Can anyone tell me where you would normally see the title appear in the
browser?

[wait for answer]

Places you'll see the contents of the =title= used include:

- In the tab for the page in the browser
- The default name for the page's bookmark
- In a search engine result page

Moving down the page, we close the =head= element, and open a new
=body= element. The =body= should contain *all* the content that you
want to show to the user, whether that's text, images, videos, or
whatever else.

#+END_NOTES

** Adding images

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<img src="name-of-file.png" alt="Image of ...">
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
TODO(nik): Download and prepare an image for them to use.

To add an image to a page we use the =img= element. This introduces
two new concepts.

The first is the idea of an *empty element*. Remember earlier when I
said that all elements have a start tag, content, and an end tag.

And remembe even earlier when I said that teaching is all about lying
to students? This is one of those times.

Some elements are what we call empty elements. They have no content,
and no end tag. So to write them you just use the start tag. And =img=
is one of those elements.

The second concept is *attributes*. As well as the content, an element
might have one or more attributes that you can set. Each attribute on
element has a name and a value.

These are written as the name of the attribute, then an equals sign,
and then the value, enclosed in quotes.

*Important*: These should be together -- no spaces on either side of
equals sign.

Two of the attributes the =img= element supports are =src= and =alt=.

Use =src= to specify the filename of the image to load.

Use =alt= to specify some text that should be displayed or used if the
image can not be loaded or is not useful to the user. For example,
it's possible for blind or partially sighted people to get *screen
readers* that read the contents of the page to them. In this case
the contents of the =alt= attribute is read to the user.

TODO(nik): Update with instructions on where they can get the image from.

Go ahead and add an image to your page now.

[wait]

Question: Is =img= a block-level element or an inline element? Try
it, and tell me.

#+END_NOTES

** But why?

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<!-- This does *not* work -->

<img>
  <src>name-of-file.png</src>
  <alt>Image of ...</alt>
</img>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
You might be wondering why images are empty elements with attributes?
Couldn't they be a nested element, with other elements to specify the
image file and the alternative content?

That's a great question. The answer is that, generally, element content
represents something that the user will immediately see on the page, while
attributes are used to specify how that content should be displayed, or
other information that would normally be hidden.

This is not a hard and fast rule. When HTML was first being developed
rules like this didn't really exist, and so the language is not completely
consistent about how these things are treated. It's just something you
have to get used to.


By the way, that weird element at the top with an exclamation mark and
the minus signs. That's what a comment looks like in HTML. We'll talk
more about that later.
#+END_NOTES

** Different elements support different attributes

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<!-- This does *not* work -->

<p src="name-of-file.png">...</p>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The HTML specification says which attributes are allowed for each
element, you can't just write an attribute on an element and hope it
will work.

So this example here does not work.

#+END_NOTES


** MDN and exercises

- Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
- Search for "mdn html elements"

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Mozilla is the organization responsible for, amongst other things,
the Firefox web browser, and the provide a very comprehensive set of
reference documents and tutorials online.

As a programmer you'll need to get used to reading and understanding
technical documentation, so for the rest of the afternoon you'll be
using the MDN documentation to learn about more HTML elements and add
them to your scratch page.
