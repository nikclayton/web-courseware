- we introduce ourselves as a team and explain who is the contact
  person for what
- the class introduces themselves, saying their name and something
  about this name, so we can remember their names (I can lead this)
- Hussam says a few things about Hosts/ Orga/ things they have read in
  the Email
- Sunita explains the contracts and has them signed

* About asking questions

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"All teaching is the process of lying, and then replacing the lies
 with successively better approximations of the truth."
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This course is only going to work if you all ask questions.

I mean, it's possible that I've managed to design the perfect course,
and everything is explained in enough detail at exactly the right time
for you to understand everything.

But that's pretty unlikely. So, when you have questions, ask them.

This isn't a competition as to who can understand things the fastest,
I'm not grading you on your work, or judging you based on the questions
that you're asking.

So if you have a question, ask. And if the explanation still isn't
clear, ask again.

Also -- there's varying levels of experience across all of you. If
you hear someone ask a question and you think you have another way
of explaining something that you think might be easier to understand,
that's fantastic, so do feel free to help with explanations.

This should all be very collaborative -- as I say, it's not a
competition.

One other thing -- I know, habitually, that I tend to speak quite
quickly. I'm doing my best to slow down and be really clear, but I
know that sometimes I will fail at that. When I do, and you need me
to slow down, tell me.

OK?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Progamming is a precision activity. Sometimes using an upper
case letter instead of a lower case letter can cause something
to not work.

Or having the wrong amount of spaces.

Or spelling things wrong. Or using the wrong quotes.

When I was hosting the interviews, the #1 problem I saw people
make was not following the examples / instructions precisely.

This is a skill that you will need to learn.
#+END_NOTES

* Taking notes

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Before we dive in to the course material, you're going to want to
take notes.

So get ready to do that now. If you're going to be using pen and
paper have them ready.

If you're going to be typing notes in to a file on your computer
get that ready now.

If you need me to wait because you're taking a note on something
that is *absolutely fine*. Just let me know, OK.
#+END_NOTES

* On levels of experience

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We have very different levels of experience in this group.

Some of you already have some years experience with some of these
technologies, and for some of you it's going to be the first time
you've seen it.

For those of you that already know some of this material you might
find the first couple of weeks very easy, and be tempted to stop
paying attention.

Don't.

First, I might cover some things that you've never seen before, or
do it in a way that helps explain other things that we're going to
learn.

Second, this is a valuable opportunity to practice what you do know.
Programming is difficult -- the more practice you get at the easier
things so they become second nature, the more it frees up your brain
to focus on the more difficult things, until they become easier.

Third, if you find yourself completing some of the exercises earlier
than others, this is an opportunity to help them out if they need it.
If someone in the class has a question during the exercises and I
and the other trainers are busy, do try and help them out. Explaining
something to someone else is the best way to make sure that you
understand it.

There's one other thing I wanted to address before we get started.

You're all here because -- in the technical sessions -- you
demonstrated you could:

- read and understand new material
- accurately follow instructions
- learn new things
- break problems down in to smaller parts
- solve those parts to solve the bigger problem

Those are all core traits required for any programmer, and I am
completely convinced that you can succeed at this course.

As we go through this, each one of you will almost certainly find
yourself getting to a point where you don't understand something and
it feels like you never will.

For some of you it might be in 6 weeks time. Or 3 weeks time. Or even
by the end of today. You will find youself worrying that you don't
belong on the course, that the material is too difficult, that other
people are doing this much better than you are.

This is completely normal. It's called "Imposter Syndrome".

[Google anecdote]

So I need you to remember that you absolutely belong here, and that
you are definitely able to learn and understand all the material
we're going to cover.

That said, not everyone learns at the same pace, or benefits from the
same examples. So if you do feel like you haven't understood something,
or are feeling confused, let me know. We'll schedule some 1:1 sessions
to go through the material again, or find different ways of explaining
it, or try additional exercises until it makes sense.

OK?

#+END_NOTES

* Files and directories

- Information is stored in files.
- Files have names and extensions
- Extensions are a convention that indicate the file's contents

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Everything you do as a web developer is going to involve working with files,
so it's important that you have a good mental model of how they work.

A file is a collection of information. That information might be the text of
a web page, or the data that makes up an image, or an audio file, or the data
that make up anything else.

Each file has a filename. We say that the filename is made up of three parts,
which are:

- The basename
- A full-stop character. We tend to call this 'dot'.
- Generally 1-4 characters after the dot, called the 'extension'

Conventionally, the extension is used to describe the type of data that is in
the file. For example:

- .txt  -- text files
- .html -- HTML files (more on these later)
- .png  -- Portable Network Graphics (a type of image)
- .css  -- Cascading Style Sheet (also more later)
- .js   -- Javascript (much more, later)

However, this is just a convention, and it's possible for a file's extension
to *not* match its actual contents. This can cause problems, so we'll look
at that later.

#+END_NOTES

** Show extensions on Windows

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="leftcol">
- \faWin + =extension= -> "Show or hide file extensions"
- Find "Hide extensions for known file types"
- Make sure it is *not* selected
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

[[file:windows-hide-extensions.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
For those of you with Windows computers we need to make a small change.

Trying to be helpful, Windows has a default configuration option that means
it won't show you a file's extension. This is incredibly unhelpful when
you're a frontend developer, so we need to turn that off now.

If you're using Windows 10 try these instructions.

Anyone not using Windows 10, let me know.

[Wait]
 #+END_NOTES

** Directories

 - Files are stored in directories (folders)
 - Like boxes. You can put a file in a box.
 - You can also put a box in a box.
 - This gives us a "nested" structure

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 Files are placed in collections -- the modern name for these
 collections is a "folder". However, the earlier name was
 "directory". That name is in the name of lots of commands that we'll
 use, and is still very widespread, so that's the name we'll use.

 You can think of a directory as being like a box that you can put
 files in to. You can also put a directory inside another directory --
 like putting a box inside a box.

 When we do this we say that one directory is *nested* inside the
 other.

 If you imagine that you're inside one of these boxes-as-directories,
 and climb out of it, you'll find yourself in another directory. If you
 keep doing this you'll eventually find that you can't climb out any
 more -- you've reached the *root* directory.

 The root directory has a special name, '/', or 'slash' (or forward
 slash).
 #+END_NOTES

** Paths

- Each file is in exactly one directory
- "path" is the route to the file through all the directories it is in,
  starting from the root.
- Possible paths
  - (Windows) =C:\Users\Nik Clayton\poco.txt=
  - (OS X) =/Users/nik/poco.txt=
  - (Windows) =c:/users/nik clayton/poco.txt=

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A file can only ever be in one directory at a time.

This means that we can uniquely identify a file by starting at the
root directory and then listing all the directories that we have to go
through to get to file.

We separate these directory names with a '/' slash character too.

Windows and OS X show you different slash characters for the separator,
but in Windows you can use either. For programming purposes the forward
slash is easier to use than the backward slash.

Windows also generally doesn't pay attention to the *case* of the path,
it treats upper and lower case the same. OS X does.

Windows also has *drive letters*, which are a holdover from about 30
years ago. If you're accessing a file on the same drive on Windows you
don't need to include the drive letter, but if it's on a different
drive then you do.

That generally won't be an issue in this class.

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
This is a bit like that family tree, although it's been turned upside
down.

At the top of the tree is the root directory.

Below that we have various child directories.

And here we can see the file, with its filename.

We say these this (indicate slide) is the parent directory for this
directory. Which means that this, this, and this are all child directories
of it.

And these directories (indicate slide) are siblings of each other.

Computer scientists love trees. You'll be seeing stuff like this a lot.

* Introduction to the web

- Web page
 - Text file with additional markup codes
- Web browser
  - Technical term: "user agent"
  - Processes the text and codes to display the page
- Web server
  - Receives requests for page at http://.../some/file/name
  - Responds with the page
    - Or an error code

#+BEGIN_NOTES
At its heart, a web page is a file that contains text and special codes
to specify how the text should be displayed.

This file is read by a web browser; like Chrome, or Firefox, or Safari.
The browser uses the information in the text and the special codes to
generate the final page that you can interact with.

A web server is special software that the browser talks to in order to
download a web page. We'll cover that in more detail a lot later.
#+END_NOTES

** Web pages are just text

- Open https://www.powercoders.org/
- Right-click on the page
- Choose "View source" from the menu that appears

#+BEGIN_NOTES

least some of you will never have seen before. But even then you can

files that are temporary, and you can use for experimentation. Later on
we'll create other directories for longer lived projects.

#+BEGIN_SRC html :noweb yes
<<first-html>>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
You've just created and loaded an HTML file.

HTML is *not* a programming language, it's a markup language, and we
use it to define the structure of the web page.

An HTML file consists of one or more elements, which you use to *mark
up* different parts of the page to make it appear or behave in a
particular way.  The type of element used determines whether it's a
paragraph, or an image, or a link, or anything else that HTML
supports.

An element has three main parts.

It begins with the *start tag*. This is the name of the element
surrounded by *angle brackets*. This says where the element starts.

It ends with the *end tag*. This is like the start tag, except that
the name of the element is preceded by a *forward slash*.

In between the start tag and the end tag is the element's
*content*. In this example that's the text of the element.

Together, the start tag, content, and end tag make up the element.

For the rest of this course examples are generally going to be shown
like this. On the left hand side are line numbers, which you do not
need to type in, they are so I can talk about particular lines on
the slide.

*Important*: The line numbers might not be the same as the ones you
see in Atom.

In the main area is the actual text.

And there's a little badge off to the right to make it clear which
language we're using.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
It's a good idea to get used to some keyboard shortcuts. This will
speed up your working so you don't need to take your hands from
the keyboard to the mouse and back again so frequently.

To save a file in Atom use =Ctrl= or =Command= and =s=.

Chrome will not automatically reload the file when it changes, so
you need to switch to it.

Pressing =Alt= or =Command= and =Tab= once will switch to the window
you last used. So if you went from Chrome to Atom, pressing this will
take you back to Chrome, and vice-versa.

Once you're back in Chrome, =Ctrl= or =Command= and =r= will reload
the page, allowing you to see your changes.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Broadly, we can put HTML elements in to two groups.

The first are called *block-level* elements. They form a new block on
the page -- there will be a blank line before and after each block
level elements.

These tend to represent large-scale structure on the page, so things
like

- headings
- paragraphs
- lists
- menus

and so on.

The second are called *inline elements*. These are always contained
inside a block-level element and normally only surround a small part
of the content.

Examples include:

- emphasis
- links

Try this example, save, and reload. But before you do that, try and
imagine what you think the result will be, and see if you get it
right.

  <head>
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>

    <p>This is a single paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here's a more complicated example that introduces some new elements
and best practices.

The first thing to notice is the indentation. HTML does not require
you to do this -- the browser will ignore it. However, as you can see
it makes the nested structure of the document very easy to see, to so
it is very good practice to get in to.

From now on, you should make sure that all of the HTML that you write
has correct indentation. I do that be indenting by two spaces for
each new block level element.

Lets look at this line by line.

The first line specifies the *document type*. This looks a little bit
like an element, but it isn't. Back when HTML was first being
developed the idea was that there might be lots of different document
types, and this line would tell the browser what type it was and what
rules to follow. That never really worked out, so now you just need to
include this one.

Note that the second character is an exclamation mark.

The second line is the opening tag for the =html= element. This element
should contain all the content on the page. You will also hear this
called the root element.

The =html= element should contain two child elements. The next line
introduces the first of these, =head=. This element is used to contain
various bits of additional information -- we call it *metadata* about
the page.

Here, the =head= contains a =title= element, with some text content.

Can anyone tell me where you would normally see the title appear in the
browser?

[wait for answer]

Places you'll see the contents of the =title= used include:

- In the tab for the page in the browser
- The default name for the page's bookmark
- In a search engine result page

Moving down the page, we close the =head= element, and open a new
=body= element. The =body= should contain *all* the content that you
want to show to the user, whether that's text, images, videos, or
whatever else.

We start the body with an =h1= element. This is a *Level 1 heading*,
and we talk more about those later.

Then we have a =p= element, exactly as we have already seen.

Finaly, we need to close the open =body= and =html= elements.
It's important to do those in the right order.

Now replace the contents of your =scratch/index.html= page with this,
save, and reload.

For each of the four exercises here make the change, save, and reload

Because =h= is not a valid HTML element the browser didn't know what
to do with the text. So it plays it safe, and displays it like
regular text.

By the way, in these and future examples I'm going to leave out
the =html=, =head=, and =body= elements to make space on the slides.

This time the closing tag is wrong, and doesn't close the opening
tag. The browser decided that the =h1= element stays open, and places
the =p= element *inside* the heading.

This is why the paragraph text looks the same as the heading.

In this case it doesn't look any different. We got lucky because
of where the breakage is. The browser knows that there can be
no more content after the closing =</body>= tag, so it acts as
though any tags that are still open at that point are closed.

Although the results look the same this is still bad HTML.

* Images

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<img src="name-of-file" alt="Image of ...">
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
To add an image to a page we use the =img= element.

Remember earlier when I said that teaching is all about lying
to students? This is one of those times.

Earlier I said that all elements have a start tag, content, and an end
tag.

Some elements are what we call empty elements. They have no content,
and no end tag. So to write them you just use the start tag. And =img=
is one of those elements.

The =img= element also has *attributes*.

These are written inside the start tag as the name of the attribute,
then an equals sign, and then the value, enclosed in quotes.

*Important*: These should be together -- no spaces on either side of
equals sign.

Two of the attributes the =img= element supports are =src= and =alt=.

Use =src= to specify the filename of the image to load.

Use =alt= to specify some text that should be displayed or used if the
image can not be loaded or is not useful to the user. For example,
it's possible for blind or partially sighted people to get *screen
readers* that read the contents of the page to them. In this case
the contents of the =alt= attribute is read to the user.
#+END_NOTES

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here are more things for you to try and do to break the page. I want
you to try each one of these things, and see what happens.

For each one, break it, note what happens, then fix it and make sure
the page displays OK after you fix it. Then move on to the next one.

[Wait]

[Discussion of the problems]

1. Atom didn't tell you there was a mistake. This is because Atom is
lenient, and assumes there might be some attributes that it doesn't
know about.

The lesson here is -- just because Atom says it's OK doesn't mean
it necessarily is. You still need to check.

2. The missing quote depends on which one is missing. If it's one
of the ones from the =src= attribute then the file will not be found.

If it's one of the ones from the =alt= attribute then the page should
still look like you expect, but the =alt= attribute value will not
work properly.

3. If you mis-spell the filename then the image won't be found.

** Types of images

- PNG (Portable Network Graphics), =.png=
  - Raster format
  - Lossless compression
  - Best for images with text, line-art, flat colours
- JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group), =.jpeg=, =.jpg=
  - Raster format
  - Lossy compression
  - Good for photos
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), =.svg=
  - Vector format
  - Supports interactivity and animation

#+BEGIN_NOTES
There are typically three image formats that you will encounter on the
web.

PNG and JPEG images are both examples of raster, or bitmap images.
The files contain information that describes, for each pixel of
the image, what colour and transparency the pixel has.

Both formats are *compressed*, meaning that an image takes up a lot
less space to transmit than the underlying raw image data is.

They do this compression in different ways. PNG uses *lossless*
compression. This means that if you take an image, convert it to
PNG, and then display it again you get exactly the same pixel colours
and transparency as the original image.

This makes it useful for drawings, images with lots of flat colours,
and so on.

JPEG uses *lossy* compression. Once you have converted an image to
JPEG some of the image data has been discarded. This makes the
file significantly smaller. JPEG is designed so that the data that
is thrown away normally doesn't affect the image in ways that we
can perceive, but this works best with images that are photos or
contain a lot of other detail. For other types of images this can
result in visible *artifacts*.

Unlike the other two, SVG describes the image, with information
like "Draw a line from *here* to *there*, or place a circle here,
make it red, and the outline blue.

Because of this SVG images can be made larger without becoming
blurry. They also support interactivity (such as being able to
react to clicking on different parts of the image) and animation.

SVG is best used for logos, technical drawings, and the like.

The Powercoders logo file that we downloaded was an SVG image.

<!-- This does *not* work -->

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
You might be wondering why images are empty elements with attributes?
Couldn't they be a nested element, with other elements to specify the
image file and the alternative content?

That's a great question. The answer is that, generally, element content
represents something that the user will immediately see on the page, while
attributes are used to specify how that content should be displayed, or
other information that would normally be hidden.

This is not a hard and fast rule. When HTML was first being developed
rules like this didn't really exist, and so the language is not completely
consistent about how these things are treated. It's just something you
have to get used to.

By the way, that weird element at the top with an exclamation mark and
the minus signs. That's what a comment looks like in HTML. We'll talk
more about that later.

In this example I've decided that my page consists of three logical
units. They are:

- The main content
- A footer

I've wrapped the content elements -- the paragraphs -- in =div=
elements to reflect that structure.

As you can see in the screenshot, right now this doesn't do anything
different to the presentation of the material, it looks exactly the
same. There's no extra whitespace, or indentation, or anything like
that.

This will, however, become more important in a couple of days when
we introduce stylesheets to all of this.

That's why you need to know about =div= now.

You see those =id= attributes? Those are also new. Again, there's more
on them later, but for now it's enough to know that, within each page
they must be unique, and we use them to be able to refer back to
specific =div= elements in stylesheets and other places.

Some characters are difficult to include in your HTML, because

The obvious examples are the left and right angle brackets, because

Ampersand also sometimes has problems.

Let's just recap the basic structure of every HTML page. You're
going to be doing these like this from now on.

Every page starts with the =DOCTYPE= declaration.

The first element is always =html=, which itself contains two
elements, the =head= and the =body=.

You put a =title= in the =head= element, and the rest of the
content goes inside the =body= element.

Sometimes, for reasons of space on the slides, I'm not going to
show this boilerplate, but it's always there, and when you're
creating HTML files it needs to be there too.

And don't forget the indentation!

#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES
And here are the elements we've seen so far.

Headings use =h1= through =h6=, depending on how important the
heading is.

Paragraphs are wrapped with a =p= element, while lists use either
=ol= if it's *ordered list* with numbers, or =ul= if it's an
*unordered list* with bullet points.

Either way, the individual *list items* are wrapped in =li= elements.

Images are included using the =img= element, which has an attribute,
=src= that references the file name of the image, and =alt=, which
provides alternative text to use if the image can't be used.

=div= and =span= allows us to apply additional structure to our
document, and you can use these three entities to include special
characters in the page.
